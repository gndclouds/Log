# Log

The _Log_ is a timekeeping tool for productivity and time management. It uses a generic text file as a collection of logs, converts these logs to mySQL entry commands through a simple Ruby parsing script, uploads them to a remote mySQL database, and visualizes this data through a web-based interface using PHP.

This tool is made primarily for my own use, and is designed to parse and showcase my personal data.
